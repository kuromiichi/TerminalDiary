# Terminal Diary

## About

**Terminal Diary** is a simple app created in Kotlin that runs in the terminal. It functions as a diary, allowing the user to keep track of different entries, along with an emotion related to each entry (from _depressed_ to _very happy_).

This program was created to test my knowledge and skills, and is not a serious product.

## Usage

Run the app by typing the following command into a console:

    java -jar TerminalDiary.jar

This will create a `diary.txt` file in the same directory as the jar file to store diary entries.

Follow the instructions on the screen to manage your entries.

Entries are saved in the txt file upon closing the program.
